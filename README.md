# JSON Schema Markdown Tools

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/adobe/jsonschema2md.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/adobe/jsonschema2md) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/adobe/jsonschema2md.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Documenting and validating complex JSON Schemas can be hard. This tool makes it easier by providing a number of scripts that can turn JSON Schema files into readable Markdown documentation that is ready for consumption on GitHub or processed using Jekyll or other static site generators.

These tools have been introduced by Adobe to document Adobe's Experience Data Models (XDM), but can be used for other JSON Schema documents, too.

## Requirements

- `npm` version 3.10.8 or up
- `node` v8 or up

## Example Output

Using the schemas in [`examples/schemas`](examples/schemas), the output in [`examples/docs`](examples/docs) has been generated.

## Installing and running

```bash
# clone this project
$ git clone git@github.com:adobe/jsonschema2md.git

# install dependencies
$ cd jsonschema2md && npm install

# show usage information
$ node cli.js

# run task
# leave out the -v '06', when you have draft-07 schemas
$ node cli.js -d examples/schemas -o examples/docs -v '06'
# generated output for whole folder is written to ./examples/docs
```
## JSON Schema Draft Versions

`jsonschema2md` assumes `draft-07` by default. If your schemas are not on `draft-07`, you can specify the draft version using the `-v` or `--draft` flag.

```bash
# run against JSON Schema Draft 04
$ node cli.js -d examples/schemas -o examples/docs -v 04
```

```bash
# run against JSON Schema Draft 06
$ node cli.js -d examples/schemas -o examples/docs -v 06
```

### Installing the `jsonschema2md` Command Line Tools

The JSON Schema Markdown tools also includes a convenient `jsonschema2md` command line tool that can be installed using:

```bash
$ npm link
```

The command line arguments are identical between the `jsonschema2md` binary and the `cli.js` node script.

## Using JSON Schema Markdown Tools from `npm`

You can conveniently use the JSON Schema Markdown Tools from `npm`. This makes it possible to set up a conversion toolchain for your JSON Schema project that is driven entirely by `npm`. To do so, first define the dependency by adding this to your `"devDependencies"` section of `package.json`

```json
  "devDependencies": {
    "@adobe/jsonschema2md": "^1.0.6"
  }
```

Then add the following to the `"scripts"` section of your `package.json` and adapt accordingly:

```json
"scripts": {
  "prepare": "mkdir -p docs/reference && jsonschema2md -o docs/reference -d schemas/draft-04
}
```

If you run `npm install` before running `npm run prepare`, `npm` will install the `@adobe/jsonschema2md` in a `node_modules/.bin` path, even if you did not install the JSON Schema Markdown beforehand.

## Tests

Ensure you have all the dependencies installed via `npm install`, then run:

```bash
npm test
```

This will run our Jasmine test suite as well as lint the JavaScript according to our style guide (see below).

### CI

Continuous integration runs on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/adobe/jsonschema2md). 
All pull requests automatically trigger a job that runs the [tests](#tests) by executing the [`config.yml`](.circleci/config.yml). 

### Code Coverage

You can run `npm run cover` to get a code coverage report, that is, a sense of how much of the project's code is "covered" by the test suite.

## Style Guide / Linting

This project uses [eslint](https://eslint.org) to enforce JavaScript coding style. To run the linter:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## TODOs

* JSON Schema validation:
  * property naming convention
  * vocabulary spellchecking
